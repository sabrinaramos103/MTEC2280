# Robot Arm Salt Machine (Salt Thrower) by Sabrina Ramos

## Concept of the Project:
The concept of this project is to simulate the Fortnite Salt Emote using a robot arm constructed of servos that represents
the X, Y, and Z axis. While using this the project has minimal movement just to demonstrate the how the robot will react
with a salt shaker, as this project was originally implemented to use a salt shaker. However, I had to use an alternative with
and arduino box and salt packets to replicate how the salt shaker motion will take place while demoing the project.


### What I learned while creating my project
Throughout this project I learned how to calibrate these servos to make sure the movements are exact, as well as understanding
the various constraints that are within the servos (such as only being able to go 180 to provide smooth movement). I would have
approached my project differently by creating a better way to produce the salt shaker that would fit the robot arm rather than
my current alternative. I believe that this implementation would have been better for visual demoing.
