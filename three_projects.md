The first project is Tristan Perich's Microtonal Wall which emanates different sounds as a person walks further down the speakers. 
I think this project is interesting because it uses different sounds frequencies in a range from high to low. 
I believe what I can use to recreate this would be my knowledge of sound (without the sound library) 
and the alternation of balance for these sounds.

The second project is called Ghost in the MP3 which contains a variety of lost and broke MP3 and MP4 files. 
I believe this project is scary because it can make art out of something broken. 
It represents something truly scary and frankly like a creepypasta, which has a huge story to make is visually appealing to the audience. 
I believe I can recreate this through processing, Arduino, and other means of programming knowledge to truly capture the horror.

The last project is the Suicide Machine in which it destroys itself. 
This machine uses sand and initially pushes it to the limit until it breaks down from the excess sand. 
I think this concept is interesting to see the fully limitations of creations within our field, 
as well as understanding the boundaries that our creations have. 
I think I would be able to create this with the concept of servos, Arduinos, 
and processing to create a machine that will ultimately end itself.
