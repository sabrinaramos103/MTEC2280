//Question 2.

void setup(){

 background(230); // matches the gray from the problem given
 
 stroke(0); 
 fill(230); //matches the same color as the background to give the outline
 rect(35, 35, 425, 425); // shapes the square to cover not the full window
 
 stroke(255, 0, 0); //gives the line the color red
 line(335, 250, 36, 250); //takes place inside the square outline
