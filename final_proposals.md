1) Robot Dice Roller:
   I would like to use the concept of the robot arm to properly roll a die (or dice) for any board game. 
   I would have to understand how to adjust the robot's arm movements to properly roll the dice without disrupting the system.
   This could be done using our original coding, as well as making sure it doesn't throw the die/dice too far from the user.
   This could also be done using the bluetooth for movement.
   
2) Robot Salt Machine:
   This project is initially a troll proposal, where I would recreate the salt emote from fortnite using the robot arm.
   As the robot would use a salt shaker to spread the salt on a surface in the similar motion. I would have to alter the
   code to make sure the robot turns slowly and steadily in the same emote manner. This could even be achieved through 
   automatic movement which would reset upon each notion.
   
3) Light/Sound Photocell & Speaker Show:
   This can use the concept of the robot arm, but would be much better with human interaction instead; as this project
   would combine the idea of using photocell sensors and sounds to intially create something similar to a soundboard. This 
   would have LED's within a container-- similar to Lorenzo's Pringle Project. However, it would just change and alternate sound based
   the height of the hand, as well as the lower the hand the lower the sound frequency. I would need to make sure I have LED's, 
   open containers, and speakers to recreate the light show.
