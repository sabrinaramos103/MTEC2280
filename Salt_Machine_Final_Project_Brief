The concept of this code is to simulate the Fortnite Salt Emote using a robot arm, as a fun and creative way to move
the servos and compliment each component together. As for this project, this was achieved using three servos (for X-Axis, 
Y-Axis, and Z-Axis) which would create the movement replicated with the emote itself. I wanted make this as a fun
way to salt foods (however, given the circumstances I will have the robot 'throw' salt rather than shake because of 
the salt shaker constraints regarding the project). I used a combination of our robot arm practice to create this loop
of salt shaking.
